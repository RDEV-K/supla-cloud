# SUPLA CLOUD - Frontend

This directory contains sources of frontend components used in SUPLA CLOUD.

They are written with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) supported by 
[Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/). 
The sources are built with [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/).

## How to build the sources?

Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

The first command downloads the Internet. The second one builds the sources
to the output directory (`web/assets/dist`).
