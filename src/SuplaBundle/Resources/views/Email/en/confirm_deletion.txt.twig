SUPLA - Account Removal
{% endblock %}

{% block body %}
Welcome!

We have been asked to delete your SUPLA Cloud account ({{ cloudHost() }}).

Keep in mind that we will delete all your settings, configured devices, locations, schedules and all other features
that you used in SUPLA along with your account. If you register yourself again in the future, some devices might need
reconfiguration even if you use the same e-mail address.

Click the following link to confirm removal of your account on {{ cloudHost() }}.

THIS CANNOT BE UNDONE!

{{ svrUrl(confirmationUrl) }}

If the link is not working, please copy and paste it or enter manually in a new browser window.

NOTICE!
If you do not want to delete your account on cloud.supla.org, please do not click the link.
